# 👋 Hi, I'm Mbathio

I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Cincinnati with a passion for solving real-world problems through programming, machine learning, and AI. Whether it’s developing a self-learning game with reinforcement learning or optimizing network traffic using SDN simulations, I enjoy turning complex ideas into practical solutions.

Over the past two years, I’ve worked on projects ranging from AI research and app development to building data systems, developing skills in Python, C++, Java, SQL, and tools like scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy. I’ve also explored no-code platforms like AppSheet for rapid app development.

Currently, I’m an AI Fellow with Break Through Tech, where I’m deepening my expertise in ML and real-world AI applications.

My goal is to continue growing as a developer and researcher while contributing to technology that’s ethical, impactful, and user-centered. I'm always open to learning from others and tackling new challenges.
